# TrelloClone
A partial clone of the note-taking app Trello, built
using Ruby on Rais and Backbone.js. It's not
particularly polished, particularly in terms of css
design. But it has, I think, some interesting logic
to manage Trello's drag-and-drop functionality. The
drag-and-drop animation is managed by jQuery UI, but
there's still interesting work required in keeping
track of the order of the items (both client- and
server-side).
